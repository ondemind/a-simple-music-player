A simple music player that I made using the PyQt5 module

**How to run it?**

Simply, you must download the code and then, with python, execute the "main.py" file.

Something like this: ```py main.py```

You may probably need another command to run it if you are using another version of Python or another OS.

**IMPORTANT:** In order to make the script work, you must have downloaded a Codec Pack. I think that with any Codec Pack can work, but I personally use the K-Lite Codec Pack: https://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm

This is far from being a professional Python project, so be free on making suggestions through the issues sections or doing some contributions to my project.
